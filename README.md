#Demo File for Git
Making another change from cloned repository
Making a change from cloned repository

This is a text  file that we are going to add to Git. 

We will use Git to record all of the versions of this file, 
letting us move back and forth through time. 

For example, in this first version of the file we will say that cat goes meow.
and dog goes woof
